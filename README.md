# testing_tesseract
I have tried testing tersseract for detecting text in a sheet musis.
The objective is to 

1.Identify and recognize text so as to add them into an proper music sheet after doing OMR


2.Better identification of Staves .I tried using line detection for detection of staves.A major false positice in such a case is the text in between.Removal of text will eliminate such a problem and increase the accuracy of stave detection.
